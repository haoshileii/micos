This code implements a multivariable time series representation learning framework for classification task.
We use Python 3.8 to implement the proposed method, and all experiments are run on the machine of Windows system.
To run the model, you need to put the dataset file in the dataset/ uEA path, set the necessary hyperparameters, and run the run file
